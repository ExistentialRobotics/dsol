Calib for realsense data is 

```
393.4910888671875 393.4910888671875 318.6263122558594 240.12942504882812 0.095150406
```
Put this in `calib.txt` and put it in the same folder of the realsense dataset generated by the python file.

## Build

This is a ros package, just put in a catkin workspace and build the workspace.

## Run
Open rviz using the config in `launch/dsol.rviz`

```
roslaunch dsol dsol_data.launch
```

See launch files for more details on different datasets.

See config folder for details on configs.

To run multithread and show timing every 5 frames do
```
roslaunch dsol dsol_data.launch tbb:=1 log:=5
```

## Dependencies

See CMakeLists.txt for dependencies.
